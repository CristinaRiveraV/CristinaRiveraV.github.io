              engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, with an interest on mobile and cognitive robotics, as well
              as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
            <h4>List of some courses I took</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Human robot interaction</li>
                <li>Biologically inspired computation</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligenc</li>
                <li>Swarm Intelligence </li>
                <li>Advanced Software Engineering</li>
              </ul>
             <h4>Key Technical Projects</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Robotics SLAM mapping project</strong> As part of a small team, using python
                  and ROS (software), I program a “turtle bot 2” for mapping an
                  environment whilst moving around and avoiding obstacles. The robot
                  then could use the map to navigate the area to a specified location on the              obtained map. </li>
                <li><strong>Engineers Without Borders.</strong></trong> Multidisciplinary project working with
                  chemical engineers, mechanical engineers and electrical engineers
                  The objective was to design a product to help reduce pollution in Africa.
                  At the end, the project was presented to a group of judges. </li>
                <li><strong>Coffee Shop Simulation</strong>Working with a team, used AGILE methods to
                  create an application (using Java) that would display a menu and receive
                  orders from customers in real time. Git and test driven development
                  (using JUnit 4) were used for this project.</li>
                <li><strong>Swarm Robotics (Dissertation)</strong>Using C++ to simulate different swarms
                  of robots and find the most efficient swarm size</li>
                <li><strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong>Learned to work with big datasets
                  and how to manipulate them in order to find valuable information. </li>
              </ul>

              <li>As a baker, I bake and wrap bread every morning according to the predicted sales of the day </li>
              <li>I keep the bread rotation fresh with the least amount of waste possible. To achieve this, I report the
                necessary changes to my superior as well as contact the retailers to modify the orders for replenishing the
                fresh bread depending on the needs of the shop.</li>
              <li>Other responsibilities include generally helping to stock shelves, aid customers around the shop, manning
                the till and making sure the covid-19 rules are being followed. These activities include working as a team,
                organization and time-management skills</li>

              Heriot Watt University</h3>
            <p>As a class representative I oversaw communication between students and the teaching body of the university in order
              to solve any academic problems encountered by my class, as well as helped develop a better course organization for
              upcoming students.</p>

              British Gas</h3>
            <p>This was an opportunity to spend time in an office environment. During this 2-week program I had the chance to listen
              into some phone calls and shadow a gas engineer for a day, learning great examples of good costumer service.</p>
