            <li>As a baker, I bake and wrap bread every morning according to the predicted sales of the day </li>
            <li>I keep the bread rotation fresh with the least amount of waste possible. To achieve this, I report the
              necessary changes to my superior as well as contact the retailers to modify the orders for replenishing the
              fresh bread depending on the needs of the shop.</li>
            <li>Other responsibilities include generally helping to stock shelves, aid customers around the shop, manning
              the till and making sure the covid-19 rules are being followed. These activities include working as a team,
              organization and time-management skills</li>

            to solve any academic problems encountered by my class, as well as helped develop a better course organization for
            upcoming students.</p>

            British Gas</h3>
          <p>This was an opportunity to spend time in an office environment. During this 2-week program I had the chance to listen
            into some phone calls and shadow a gas engineer for a day, learning great examples of good costumer service.</p>
