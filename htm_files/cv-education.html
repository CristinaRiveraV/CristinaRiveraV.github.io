        <h3>Bachelor of Engineering Robotics, Autonomous and Interactive Systems<br>
          Heriot Watt University (2015 – May 2019)</h3>
          <p>My degree offered a blend of theoretical and applied studies across mechanical
            engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, with an interest on mobile and cognitive robotics, as well
            as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h4>List of some courses I took</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Human robot interaction</li>
              <li>Biologically inspired computation</li>
              <li>Artificial Intelligenc</li>
              <li>Swarm Intelligence </li>
              <li>Advanced Software Engineering</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Key Technical Projects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Robotics SLAM mapping project</strong> As part of a small team, using python
                and ROS (software), I program a “turtle bot 2” for mapping an
                environment whilst moving around and avoiding obstacles. The robot
                then could use the map to navigate the area to a specified location on the
                obtained map. </li>
              <li><strong>Engineers Without Borders.</strong></trong> Multidisciplinary project working with
                chemical engineers, mechanical engineers and electrical engineers
                The objective was to design a product to help reduce pollution in Africa.
                At the end, the project was presented to a group of judges. </li>
              <li><strong>Coffee Shop Simulation</strong>Working with a team, used AGILE methods to
                create an application (using Java) that would display a menu and receive
                orders from customers in real time. Git and test driven development
                (using JUnit 4) were used for this project.</li>
              <li><strong>Swarm Robotics (Dissertation)</strong>Using C++ to simulate different swarms
                of robots and find the most efficient swarm size</li>
              <li><strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong>Learned to work with big datasets
                and how to manipulate them in order to find valuable information. </li>
            </ul>
