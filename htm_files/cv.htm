      <article><p>During the past year I’ve been working in a local shop, originally as a part time job but full time during the covid-19
        pandemic. Now that my visa has been processed, I am ready to put my transferable skills to work in the industry

        <h3>Bachelor of Engineering Robotics, Autonomous and Interactive Systems<br>
          Heriot Watt University (2015 – May 2019)</h3>
          <p>My degree offered a blend of theoretical and applied studies across mechanical
            engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, with an interest on mobile and cognitive robotics, as well
            as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h4>List of some courses I took</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Human robot interaction</li>
              <li>Biologically inspired computation</li>
              <li>Artificial Intelligenc</li>
              <li>Swarm Intelligence </li>
              <li>Advanced Software Engineering</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Key Technical Projects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Robotics SLAM mapping project</strong> As part of a small team, using python
                and ROS (software), I program a “turtle bot 2” for mapping an
                environment whilst moving around and avoiding obstacles. The robot
                then could use the map to navigate the area to a specified location on the
                obtained map. </li>
              <li><strong>Engineers Without Borders.</strong></trong> Multidisciplinary project working with
                chemical engineers, mechanical engineers and electrical engineers
                The objective was to design a product to help reduce pollution in Africa.
                At the end, the project was presented to a group of judges. </li>
              <li><strong>Coffee Shop Simulation</strong>Working with a team, used AGILE methods to
                create an application (using Java) that would display a menu and receive
                orders from customers in real time. Git and test driven development
                (using JUnit 4) were used for this project.</li>
              <li><strong>Swarm Robotics (Dissertation)</strong>Using C++ to simulate different swarms
                of robots and find the most efficient swarm size</li>
              <li><strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong>Learned to work with big datasets
                and how to manipulate them in order to find valuable information. </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Basics on Audio Engineering <br> Massive Sound Studio (Mexico 2014 - 2015)</h3>
          <p>Audio Editing with Pro-Tools, as well as recording audio in a studio setting</p>

          <h4>Key Responsibilities</h4>
          <ul class="keyresp">
            <li>As a baker, I bake and wrap bread every morning according to the predicted sales of the day </li>
            <li>I keep the bread rotation fresh with the least amount of waste possible. To achieve this, I report the
              necessary changes to my superior as well as contact the retailers to modify the orders for replenishing the
              fresh bread depending on the needs of the shop.</li>
            <li>Other responsibilities include generally helping to stock shelves, aid customers around the shop, manning
              the till and making sure the covid-19 rules are being followed. These activities include working as a team,
              organization and time-management skills</li>

            Heriot Watt University</h3>
          <p>As a class representative I oversaw communication between students and the teaching body of the university in order
            to solve any academic problems encountered by my class, as well as helped develop a better course organization for
            upcoming students.</p>

            British Gas</h3>
          <p>This was an opportunity to spend time in an office environment. During this 2-week program I had the chance to listen
            into some phone calls and shadow a gas engineer for a day, learning great examples of good costumer service.</p>
