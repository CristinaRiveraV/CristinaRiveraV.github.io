          <h3>Movement to work (Aug 19 – 31, 2019)<br></br>
            <em>British Gas</em></h3>
          <p>This was an opportunity to spend time in an office environment. During this 2-week program I had the chance to listen
            into some phone calls and shadow a gas engineer for a day, learning great examples of good costumer service.</p>
