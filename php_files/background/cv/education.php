      <em>Heriot Watt University (2015 – May 2019)</em></h3>
        <p>My degree offered a blend of theoretical and applied studies across mechanical
          engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, with an interest on mobile and cognitive robotics, as well
          as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <h4>Some courses I took:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>Human robot interaction</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>Biologically inspired computation</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>Artificial Intelligenc</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>Swarm Intelligence </li>

          </ul>
        <h4>Key Technical Projects</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i><strong>Robotics SLAM mapping project</strong> As part of a small team, using python
              and ROS (software), I program a “turtle bot 2” for mapping an
              environment whilst moving around and avoiding obstacles. The robot
              then could use the map to navigate the area to a specified location on the
              obtained map. </li><br>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i><strong>Engineers Without Borders.</strong></trong> Multidisciplinary project working with
              chemical engineers, mechanical engineers and electrical engineers
              The objective was to design a product to help reduce pollution in Africa.
              At the end, the project was presented to a group of judges. </li><br>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i><strong>Coffee Shop Simulation</strong>Working with a team, used AGILE methods to
              create an application (using Java) that would display a menu and receive
              orders from customers in real time. Git and test driven development
              (using JUnit 4) were used for this project.</li><br>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i><strong>Swarm Robotics (Dissertation)</strong>Using C++ to simulate different swarms
              of robots and find the most efficient swarm size</li><br>
            <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i><strong>Data Mining and Machine Learning</strong>Learned to work with big datasets
              and how to manipulate them in order to find valuable information. </li><br>
          </ul>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-university"></i>Basics on Audio Engineering <br>
      <em>Massive Sound Studio (Mexico 2014 - 2015)</em></h3>
        <p>Audio Editing with Pro-Tools, as well as recording audio in a studio setting</p><br>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-university"></i>New York High School Diploma (June 2014)<br>
